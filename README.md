## ⚙️ Download the php_to_js.php class

**Note: Make sure to add the class to your project and include it. If you are unsure how to use it, refer to the example provided below.**

## Example Usage



```php
<?php
//include class
include "./php_to_js.php";

//we create object for this class.
$php_to_js = new php_to_js();
//we enter the Variable and put value inside it.
$php_to_js->displayVariable("fromphp","this value its from php");

?>
```
Now If you console.log(fromphp) you can see the text you have in php: **this value its from php**
